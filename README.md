# TEST_DS: 

- Code to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance (available at 'data_input/auto-insurance-fall-2017') of target TARGET_FLAG.
The code explicitly returns the value of the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric and it generates a .csv file with the predictions.

- The results are stored in the 'results' folder. 

- The main of the code to be run is: 'TEST_ML_DS_MariaInfantino.py'

- All the other routines contained in the repository are called from the main.
